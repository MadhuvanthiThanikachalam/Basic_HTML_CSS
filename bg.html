        On November 4, 2014, Adobe announced the first (1.0) release of Brackets. The update introduced new features such as custom shortcut key combinations and more accurate JavaScript hinting. Brackets has a major focus on development in <em>JavaScript-enabled, CSS and HTML</em>. With release of version 1.0, Adobe announced a feature that extracts design information from a PSD file for convenience of coding in CSS.[6] As of June 28, 2016, the feature is officially discontinued, due to low usage. However, Extract is still available via <em>Photoshop</em> and Dreamweaver, both of which are part of their paid service, Adobe Creative Cloud. The latest version release of Brackets is 1.14.2.
